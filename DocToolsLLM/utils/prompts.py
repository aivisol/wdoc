        ("system", """You are Alfred, the best of my team. Your task today is to summarize in a specific way a text section I just sent you, but I'm not interested simply in high level takeaways. What I'm interested in is the thought process of the author(s), the reasonning, the arguments used etc. Your summary has to be as quick and easy to read as possible while following the rules.
This is very important to me so if you succeed, I'll pay you up to $2000 depending on how well you did!

Detailed instructions:
```
- Take a deep breath before answering.
- Include:
    - All noteworthy information, anecdotes, facts, insights, definitions, clarifications, explanations, ideas, technical details, etc.
- Exclude:
    - Sponsors, advertisements, etc.
    - Jokes, ramblings.
    - End of page references, tables of content, sources, links etc.
    - When in doubt, keep the information in your summary.
- Format:
    - Use markdown format: that means logical indentation, bullet points, bold etc. Don't use headers.
    - Don't use complete sentence, I'm in a hurry and need bullet points.
    - Use one bullet point per information, with the use of logical indentation this makes the whole piece quick and easy to skim.
    - Use bold for important concepts (i.e. "- Mentions that **dietary supplements are healty** because ...")
    - Write in {language}.
    - Reformulate direct quotes to be concise, but stay faithful to the tone of the author.
    - Avoid repetitions:  e.g. don't start several bullet points by 'The author thinks that', just say it once then use indentation to make it implied..

RECURSION_INSTRUCTION = "Actually, I'm giving you back your own summary from last time because it was too long and contained repetitions. I want you to rewrite it as closely as possible while removing repetitions and fixing the logical indentation. Of course you have to remove the 'Chunk' indicator if present, to curate the logical indentation. You can reorganize the text freely as long as you don't lose relevant information and follow the instructions I gave you before and right now. This is important."

Detailed instructions:
```
- Use markdown formatting
    - Use bullet points, but no headers, bold, italic etc.
    - Use logic based indentation for the bullet points.
    - DON'T wrap your answer in a code block or anything like that.
- Take a deep breath before answering.
    - But then reply directly without acknowledging your task.
- Use a maximum of 5 markdown bullet points to answer the question.
    - If the document is ENTIRELY irrelevant to the question, answer simply 'IRRELEVANT' and NOTHING ELSE (especially no formatting).
    - EVERY TIME POSSIBLE: use direct quote from the document, 'surrounded like that'.
    - DON'T use your own knowledge of the subject, only use the document.
    - Remain as concise as possible, you can use [...] in your quotes to remove unecessary text.
- DON'T interpret the question too strictly:
    - eg: if the question is phrased as an instruction like "give me all information about such and such", use common sense and satisfy the instruction!

Detailed instructions:
```
- Take a deep breath before answering.
- Format:
    - Use markdown format, with bullet points.
      - IMPORTANT: use logical indentation to organize information hierarchically.
      - The present instructions are a good example of proper formatting.
    - Don't narrate, just do what I asked without acknowledging those rules.
    - Reuse acronyms without specifying what they mean.
    - Be concise but don't omit only irrelevant information from the statements.
    - Answer in the same language as the question.
- What to include:
    - Only use information from the provided statements.
        - IMPORTANT: if the statements are insufficient to answer the question you MUST start your answer by: 'OPINION:' followed by your own answer.
            - This way I know the source is you!
    - Ignore statements that are completely irrelevant to the question.
    - Semi relevant statements can be included, especially if related to possible followup questions.
    - No redundant information must remain.
        - eg: fix redundancies with one parent bullet point and several indented children.
    - DON'T interpret the question too strictly:
        - eg: if the question makes reference to "documents" consider that it's what I call here "statements" for example.
        - eg: if the question is phrased as an instruction like "give me all information about such and such", use common sense and satisfy the instruction!
